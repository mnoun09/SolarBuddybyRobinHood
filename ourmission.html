									<h2>What?</h2>
									<h3>The Harmful Effects of Fast Fashion</h3>
									<h4>An estimated 11.3 Million Tons of Textile Waste end up in U.S. Landfills Yearly </h4>
									<p>Clothing goes “out of trend” is never worn again or ends up in landfill. Clothes used to come in seasons. Every year, we double the amount of clothes we make, we double the amount of waste we make, yet we half the value of creativity that goes into clothes, and we half the value of Earth. Online websites such as Shein have produced fast fashion cheaper and faster than ever. These clothings are barely worn and tossed aside when there is a new fashion trend. About 66% of textile waste goes to landfill and 19% are burned.</p>

									<h3>The Unhoused Problem in LA County</h3>
									<h4>About 150 Million People Worldwide are Unhoused </h4>
									<p>Every country have their issues with homelessness. However in the United States, Los Angeles is one of the cities with the largest unhoused population. There is a lack of affordable housing and laws protecting tenants. The homeless crisis grew steadily over the pandemic as several people became unemployed.</p>

									<h2>Why?</h2>
									<p>Our Earth is being polluted by clothes. When items are burned, the often emit toxic chemicals which pollute the air. Clothes that ends up in landfills vary in duration to decompose depending on the material. 100% cotton decomposes within months where as polyester can take 20 to 200 years. Meanwhile the amount of trash in our landfills will only go increase. Our Earth will soon be drowned in clothes.</p>
									<p>Each year there are more instances of deaths among the homeless population in LA due to the cold than New York. Yet New York's conditions are harsher. This is due to the lack of shelters available to the population in LA. They are exposed to the outside whereas the homeless in New York are at least increase, although their stay in a shelter is temporary. </p>

									<h2>How?</h2>
									<p>Our product, the Solar Buddy is a backpack which provides a warm sleeping bag on a cold day. The heated sleeping bag is stored inside the backpack where the consumer can also store their items in the additional pockets. The sleeping bag is powered by a solar panel on the front of the backpack which stores electricity. The solar bag isn't limited to being used to the sleeping bag. It can be used to charge a phone or power other items. </p>
									<p>The Solar Buddy costs $49.60. We understand that someone who is unhoused may not have this amount of money at once. Others are able to donate a backpack, which we will deliver to someone in need, as well as donating money to help fund a Solar Buddy, or donating clothes. The Solar Buddy is mostly made with recycled materials, mainly from donated clothes that we recieve. We hope to be able lower the costs as much as we can, as we recieve more support.</p>
